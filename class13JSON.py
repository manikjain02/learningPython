# JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
# JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, which includes C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data interchange language.
# JSON is built on two structures:
# 1. A collection of name/value pairs (often called an object, dictionary, or hash table in various languages).
# 2. An ordered list of values (often called an array, vector, list, or sequence in various languages).
# JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages. These properties make JSON an ideal data interchange language.
# JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection in a process known as serialization.
# JSON is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers. It is also used for configuration files and for data storage.

# Serialization: The process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and reconstructed later. In Python, this is often done using the `json` module, which can convert Python objects into JSON strings and vice versa.
# Deserialization: The process of converting a serialized format (like JSON) back into an object. In Python, this is done using the `json` module to parse JSON strings and convert them back into Python objects.
